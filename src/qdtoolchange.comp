description """
qdtoolchange manages the Dana Summit Quickdraw tool changer.o

The \\fBQuickdraw\\fR tool changer hardware has five inputs and two outputs.
The five inputs start the various actions of the changer, and the two outputs
give feedback on its operation. The RESET output is a contact closure which
signals that the previously-commanded operation is complete. In addition, this
component requires an input from the +12V supply on pin 12 of the M-POSITITION
connector J7. This input is used to determine whether the tool changer front
panel is switched to the AUTO position.  If the switched is changed to MAN or
LOC, the logic here assumes the operator may have moved the carousel and
unhomes the carousel. This will require a homing operation before any tools can
be used.

To allow manual or automatic tool changes, the iocontrol.tool-change hal signal
should be directed to either a manual tool change component such as
hal_manualtoolchange, or to this component's toolchange-req.  The tool_changed
output from this and the equivalent from the manual tool change component should be or-ed together
and fed to iocontrol.0.tool-changed

This component will issue an rtapi error if it sees a toolchange-req input when
the qd_auto input is not TRUE.

When this component gets a tool change request from iocontrol, it evaluates the
homed status and the new tool number. If the tool changer is not homed, the
changer will be homed first. If there is a tool in the spindle it will be
returned to the carousel at its current location, then the carousel homed if
needed, then the carousel will be moved to the new tool, and that tool moved to
the spindle.

Note that since the Quickdraw tool changer cannot prepare a tool before it is
needed, there must be a hal loopback connection between the prepare tool
request and the tool_prepared answer, like this: net tool-prepare-loopback
iocontrol.0.tool-prepare => iocontrol.0.tool-prepared

When an error occurs, bits in the error-mask output pin indicate what the error is:
0 -- No Error
1 -- Invalid tool-num input
2 -- Spindle-to-Carousel Arm Movement Timed Out
3 -- Carousel-to-Spindle Arm Movement Timed Out
4 -- qd_complete Input Stuck Low
5 -- qd_complete Input Stuck High
6 -- Carousel Movement Timed Out
7 -- Carousel Home Operation Timed Out
8 -- Auto Mode not Selected on Quickdraw Front Panel
9 -- Claw Open Signal not Seen. Possible Air Pressure Problem

The operation of this component is as a state machine. It has 8 states, described here:
0. STATE_IDLE -- Does nothing except to monitor for a new tool request.
1. STATE_WAIT_COMPL_FALSE -- Waits for the debounced complete input has gone FALSE. If the time 
exceeds complete_max_time, issues an error.
2. STATE_INIT -- Entered when a new tool request is received. Does the following:
a. Check that the carousel has been homed. If not, home it now.
b. Check whether the new requested tool and the previous tool are the same. If so sets complete and 
returns to idle.
c. Check that the complete input pin is FALSE. If not, wait for it but not longer than complete_max_time
d. Determines how far and in which direction to move the carousel to the next desired tool.
e. Sets the CHANGING output to TRUE.
f. Starts the main timer.
g. Sets the next state, which depends on the input pins.
3. STATE_TOOL_OUT -- Issues a TOOL_OUT command to the hardware and waits for completion or timeout.
4. STATE_TOOL_IN -- Issues a TOOL_IN command to the hardware and waits for completion or timeout.
5. STATE_CAROUSEL_MOVE -- Issues carousel_cw_command or carousel_ccw_command commands to the hardare.
Counts complete pulses to determine when the new tool is in the active position.
6. STATE_CAROUSEL_HOME -- Issues a carousel_home_command command to the hardware and waits for completion or timeout.
7. STATE_ERROR -- Entered if an error occurs. Changes to STATE_IDLE when machine is turned from off to on.
